                              Hi and welcome to episode number 83 of the weekly 
                              Google Cloud platform podcast. I am princess Campo 
                              and I'm here with my colleague Mark Mendel. Hey, 
                              Mark, how are you doing? I'm doing very very very 
                              well. How you doing Friends Ask? I'm pretty good. It's 
                              been a long week, but you know pretty good very 
                              excited about a very cool episode about public data 
                              sets. Yeah, it's super cool where we talk about how 
                              we host all these really large data sets for all 
                              these people to play with and do fun things with 
                              yeah. I've used some of them before my favorite one 
                              is we have a lot of good from GitHub. You can do 
                              cool things with it, but it's not the only one. So 
                              we're going to be talking about a bunch of different 
                              ones that you can just go and use and have fun with 
                              them. And after that we have a question of the week 
                              that is actually a question of the week whose answer 
                              comes from someone. We interviewed in the future. So 
                              at some point we'll have him on the podcast. But for 
                              now, we have something that he
