"""BigQuery query to feed into Dataflow.

This query is broken down into different subqueries:
  - songs: limit the universe of songs to just the top n most played.
  - user_songs: get (user, song) pairs and corresponding features.
  - user_tags: get the counts for each (user, tag) pair.
  - top_tags: get the 20 most frequent tags.
  - tag_table: initialize a num_users x top_tags table.
  - user_tag_features: fill in the tag_table using the counts from user_tags.
  - user_features: construct features specific to each user.
  - item_features: construct features specific to each item.
